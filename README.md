About this project:

This COVID19 Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview on the current status of the pandemic, with data sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The dashboard contains two pages: 
a. The HOME Page - Provides an overall summary of the number of confirmed cases and deaths region-wise and top 20 most affected countries by number of confirmed cases.
b. The SUMMARY Page - Is a region-wise interactive summary of the key metrices with a 7 day moving average of confirmed cases and deaths.

Tooltips have been used to make the report more dynamic.

Note: Currently the data points on the map are not populating with the latitude and longitude. I am currently looking into this and will be updating the fixed version soon.

DATA:

The source data used is the WHO .csv file web link : https://covid19.who.int/info/
Since the direct link has been used, the numbers update automatically and show the most recent numbers.

The country and region codes with latitude and longitude has been sourced from : https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/countries_csv
