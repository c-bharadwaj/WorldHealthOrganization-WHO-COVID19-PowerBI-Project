##### About this project:

This COVID19 Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview on the current status of the pandemic, with data sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The dashboard contains two pages: 
##### a. The HOME Page - Provides an overall summary of the number of confirmed cases and deaths region-wise and top 20 most affected countries by number of confirmed cases.
##### b. The SUMMARY Page - Is a region-wise interactive summary of the key metrices with a 7 day moving average of confirmed cases and deaths.

Tooltips have been used to make the report more dynamic.

##### DATA:
